## Discussion

The pandemic started gradually and increased exponentially within a month in year 2020. According to statistics Australia's health (2022), first case was reported in Australia on 25 
January 2020 and the number increased rapidly to 11,000 by 6 August 2020. The visualisation confirmed it as mobility decreased rapidly during this time. From the visualisations, Darwinâ€™s 
mobility with respect to the baseline shows little change to the movement of people during the pandemic. A quick glance at the population of states and COVID-19 cases in Australia 
shows that Northern Territory has the lowest population and lowest cases, hence, the low mobility seen on the visualisations. However, for cities in states with high population like New 
South Wales (NSW), Victoria, and Queensland, workplaces, and parks mobilities took more rapid decreased below the baseline. However, this decrease became more effective in May
2020, whereas social distancing rule started as early as 23 March 2020. If more drastic action were taken on time, the number of cases would likely not be as much as was recorded.
Western Australia, South Australia and Northern Territory closed their borders earlier in 24 March, while Victoria and NSW closed their borders on 8 July, after a spike in the number of 
cases reported in Melbourne. These states recorded very high number of cases. First dose of the vaccination was rolled on 21 February 2021. First in Sydney and then all over 
the country although the roll out was criticised as slow and fell short of its initial targets. Cases went down between 28 December 2020 and 13 April 2021. Restrictions were relaxed during 
this period which led heightened cases in July 2021. The visualisations during this period confirmed increase in parks and workplaces mobilities. By year 2022, the pandemic has 
subsided with only few cases reported. Workplace and parks mobility started increasing since the whole restriction was eased.

## Findings
Based on the visualisation and statistics on the pandemic, my findings are listed below:
1. Some of the states with high COVID-19 cases were not pro-active enough. Borders could have been closed earlier especially when the government announced 
lockdowns.
2. Relaxation of the lockdown after the first roll out of the vaccination might have been too early, hence, cause a spike in the in the number of cases.
3. Though the mobility in parks was below the baseline, it still has some number of high mobility in some states. This might imply that people were going to the park for
relaxation instead of just being home as the policy was then. As much as relaxing in the park is good for relaxation, caution might as well be taken to ensure that it is not 
one cause for spread of the disease.
4. For the future pandemic, states with more population should take the lead in restricting movement as soon as possible.
