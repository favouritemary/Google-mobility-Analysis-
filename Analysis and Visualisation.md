# Analysis and Visualisation
In this analysis, the mobility of each city was plotted together to understand the behaviour of 
people as well as the comparison among those cities for years 2020, 2021 and 2022. Due to
the large amount of data for a whole year the data was aggregated by month and the mean 
was calculated. The data was plotted with a baseline at y-axis = 0, which was shown with a 
bold red line to mark the regular mobility before the pandemic. Above the line signifies 
positive mobility while below it signifies negative mobility. Some of the cities have missing 
values which were filled with neighbouring values.

## Mobility for year 2020

### Parks mobility

Mobility categories for workplaces and residentials exhibit contrasting trends across all cities. All the cities experienced a decreased workplaces mobility below the 
baseline from April 2020 till the end of the year except Darwin which surpassed the baseline at different time in the year. But for residential mobility, all the cities were above the baseline 
as expected, although Darwin had the lowest mobility. For the park category, the mobility for Darwin and Australian Capital Territory (ACT), were above the baseline all through the year while the others were below the baseline.


## Mobility for year 2021

### Residential mobility

Like the observations in 2020, Darwin consistently maintained park mobility above the baseline while Adelaide and ACT fluctuates around the baseline. For 
the workplaces mobility, Darwin still has mobility above the baseline all through the year while Hobart was at some points during the year above the baseline. Interestingly, the pattern for 
workplaces mobility appears inversely related to residential mobility. In contrast, all the cities have the residential mobility above the baseline as expected, though 
Darwin continues to have the lowest mobility.

## Mobility for year 2022
### Parks mobility

Following the trends from 2020 and 2021, Darwin has its park and workplaces mobilities above the baseline and its residential mobility the 
lowest among other cities.
